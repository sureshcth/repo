Welcome to the code for "The Well-Grounded Rubyist!"

To find your way around, you need to know a few things.

* Whenever you see Listing x.y in the text (like, Listing 4.3), 
  that listing is in the file called x_y.rb (like, 4_3.rb). 

* The many examples that are not officially "Listings" in the
  text are included here as snippets. They are numbered by
  chapter, and within chapter consecutively by letter -- for
  example, 12_snippet_f.rb is the sixth snippet in chapter 12. 

* "Snippet" is a rather vague term. I've collected those that
  I think you might actually want to run. I have not included
  any irb transcriptions, and there are some very short ones that
  it really isn't worth putting in a file. 

* A certain number of examples are also included in more explicitly
  named files. I've tried to do that wherever the text actually tells
  you to create a file of a certain name. It's possible I've missed
  a couple, but you should be able to find the code among the "snippet"
  files for the appropriate chapter if you don't see a file with the
  actual name. 

* There are a few files with hybrid names, like 6_block_local.rb. They
  should be easy to place as to chapter and which example they are.

* When you see things like "#1" or "#A" scattered around the code,
  those are left over from marking the code up for the "cueballs" and
  annotations. They're all comments, so they shouldn't affect the
  running of the code. 

Enjoy, and please let us know if you spot problems (things that don't
run, differences between the files and the book, etc.). Thanks!
